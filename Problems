Q1. It doesnt let me send it
  Gmail is usually to secure to be able to send it so you would need to go to 
    Gmail-Manage your google account-press on the little magnyfying glass-App passwords-Type in your password-under app name-Name it whatever you want and copy the code it gives you
      Now you copy that code and you put it next to email on our login arguments.
Q2. It still doesnt work
  Make sure 2fa is enabled
If this still doesn't work make sure you have typed in the right email and senders. 
If nothing else works feel free to message me.
